<h1>Time for a quick intro</h1>
<p>Hej people! I am Aliki, 30 and 100% Balkan-Greek. I used to be a preschool teacher but..yeh..that was not for me. heh. Now I am a Digital Marketeer and I freakin lov it.
</p>

<p> I have lived in Greece, Sweden, Germany and Indonesia and now searching my new place. I freakin' love Asian food, cooking it and of course devouring it. Career for me is a very big part of life and I am currently focused on getting myself a good-ass job in the industry. However in such fields it is good if you never stop developing and advancing your skills. With that being said, here I am to finally start learning new 'languages' </p>

<p>Well that's enough for now. Time to do some yoga and see you around.</p>
